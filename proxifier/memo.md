# Memo
Useful
- [Proxifier Doc](http://www.proxifier.com/docs/mac-v2/)
- ~~Convert IP address from CIDR/Netmask format to range by [ipconvert](http://ip.chacuo.net/ipconvert).~~
- Convert CIDR with Python 3 script
- **Detect DNS settings automatically** option doesn't prevent DNS pollution?
- remove lines with `#` in dnsmasq-china-list

## TODO
- [x] Change China IP source to [17mon/china_ip_list](https://github.com/17mon/china_ip_list), which is based on ipip.net
- [x] Set `*.ppx` within `Proxifier/` as text to be diffed, other `.ppx` are treated as binary
- [ ] Merge some rules from [Jamesits/proxifier-profiles](https://github.com/Jamesits/proxifier-profiles)
- [ ] [felixonmars/dnsmasq-china-list](https://github.com/felixonmars/dnsmasq-china-list)
